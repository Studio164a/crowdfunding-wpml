All-in-one WPML Crowdfunding Campaigns
=================
If you are running a multilingual crowdfunding website and you want a single campaign to have multiple language versions, this is the plugin you need.   

It works alongside WPML and Appthemer Crowdfunding, ensuring that when you have created translations of your campaign, contributions to each language-specific version of the campaign count towards the same campaign. 

This plugin requires zero configuration. Just install it and you're done.

While this theme should work with any theme created with Appthemer Crowdfunding, we have personally tested it with our premium crowdfunding theme:
