Unify WPML translation versions of a crowdfunding campaign so that contributions to each language version count towards the main campaign.

== Description ==

If you are running a multi-lingual crowdfunding website and you want a single campaign to have multiple language versions, this is the plugin you need. It works alongside WPML and Appthemer Crowdfunding, ensuring that when you have created translations of your campaign, contributions to each language-specific version of the campaign count towards the same campaign. 

**Requirements**

* Appthemer Crowdfunding 1.7+
* WPML 2.9+
* Easy Digital Downloads 1.8+
* Wordpress 3.7+ (will probably work with earlier versions, but support will not be provided for older installations)
